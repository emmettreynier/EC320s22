## Installation

Having R and R Studio on your laptop will allow you to work on problem sets and explore the magnificent functionality of R outside the lab. R is the language and R Studio helps us interact with R. It is important that you **install R before you install R Studio.**

### Install R

In your web browser, go to [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org) and then click [download R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). At this point, you'll be directed to a page with a list of institutions that host the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The idea is to pick an institution near you. Scroll down to USA and click the link for either [UC Berkeley](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu) or [OSU](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/). The choice is arbitrary, but you can maintain a Beaver-free machine by picking Berkeley. Also, the Ducks play Cal this week. Know your enemy.

**Windows Instructions:** If you have a Windows machine, click `Download R for Windows` then `install R for the first time` then `Download R 3.6.1 for Windows`. To complete installation, run the `.exe` file you downloaded.

**Mac Instructions:** If you have a Mac, click `Download R for (Mac) OS X` then `R-3.6.1.pkg` under "latest release." To complete installation, run the `.pkg` file you downloaded.

**Linux Instructions:** If you run a Linux distro, note that installation instructions vary by distro. That said, you probably know what you're doing.

### Install R Studio

In your web browser, go to [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), scroll down to R Studio Desktop, and then click [Download RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) under "Open Source Edition." Scroll down to "Installers for Supported Platforms" and click the link that corresponds with your operating system. To complete installation, run the installer you downloaded.

## R Basics

### Using the console

When you open R Studio for the first time, you should notice three panels. The large panel to the left is the **console**. This is where you run code that tells R what to do. You can also use the console as a calculator. For example, if you type `5+5*2-1` in the console and hit `Enter`, then R will return
```{r, echo = FALSE}
5+5*2-1
```
in the console. 

### Everything is an object

The upper-right panel is the **global environment**. This is where R Studio stores datasets, user-defined functions, and other **objects**. 

To define an object, you use the **assignment operator** `<-`. For example, suppose that you want to assign the number 5 to an object called `a`. In the console, you would type
```{r}
a <- 5
```
which reads "`a` gets 5." When you execute this code (by hitting `Enter`), `a` will show up in the global environment. Hovering your cursor over `a` in the global environment tells you that `a` is a numeric object.

There are other kinds of objects, too. For example,
```{r}
b <- "I Love Metrics"
```
is a character object, and 
```{r}
mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4),
              nrow = 2)
```
is a matrix.

One of the nice features of R is that it can store multiple objects at a time. This is especially useful for analyzing data in a `data.frame` object and then storing the results in another `data.frame` object. It is also useful for cleaning and merging data. You might think that the ability to store multiple datasets is a trivial feature, but many other statistics packages can't do this.

### Packages

R functions come in packages. When you open a fresh R session in R Studio, a number of packages come pre-loaded. These include packages with common math and statistics functions and are known collectively as "base R." Base R is wonderful, but non-default packages offer a great deal of flexibility and functionality. 

**Install a package:** `install.packages("package.name.here")`

- Replace `package.name.here` with the name of the package you want to install.
- Make sure the name of the package is in quotes.
- You only have to install a package once.

Alternatively, you can click on the `Packages` tab of the bottom-right panel:

**Load a package:** `library(package.name.here)`

- To use functions from a non-base package, you need to load the package at the beginning of each new R session.
- Quotes around the package name are no longer needed.

#### **`pacman`**

We will often need to load several packages in a single session. One way to do this is to execute `library(package.1)`, then `library(package.2)`, then `library(package.3)`, and so forth. A less cumbersome way to load multiple packages is to use the `p_load` function from the `pacman` package. 

- Use the instructions above to **install `pacman`**.
- Load the `pacman` package with `library(pacman)`.
- When you want to load additional packages, you can then execute `p_load(package.1, package.2, package.3)`.
- **Added bonus:** `p_load` first checks to see if the packages are installed. If they aren't, then it will install them for you.

### R scripts

To produce reproducible R code, it is best to use scripts. Open a new R script file with the `.R` extension by clicking `File` then `New File` then `R Script`. We will write our first script to generate a histogram and scatter plot using `ggplot2`.

### `ggplot2`

Start by writing code to install and load `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(ggplot2)
```

- To execute *one line of your script*, click the line you want to run and then click `Run` at the upper-right corner of your R script. A quicker alternative is to click the line you want to run and then use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` `Enter`. 
- To execute *the entire script*, click `Source` at the upper-right corner of your R script or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` `Alt` `R`.

**Aside:** It is useful to leave comments in your code to explain to your future self what your code is doing and why. You can leave a comment by typing a hash `#`:

```{r}
# This is a comment. R will ignore it.
```

Check out the example dataset `midwest` from `ggplot2`. You can view the first few rows of the dataset with variable names by using the `head` function.

```{r}
head(midwest)
```

Next, make a histogram of county poverty rates (measured by the variable `percbelowpoverty`) using the `ggplot` function. You will need to tell `ggplot` 

- The name of the dataset.
- The name of the variable.
- The type of graph (in this case, `geom_histogram()`).

```{r}
ggplot(data = midwest, aes(x = percbelowpoverty)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

How many counties have poverty rates over 40 percent? What is the modal poverty rate?

To visualize relationships between variables, you can make a scatter plot. Do poverty rates appear positively or negatively correlated with race, as measured by the variable `percblack`?

```{r}
ggplot(data = midwest, aes(x = percblack, y = percbelowpoverty)) + 
  geom_point()
```
