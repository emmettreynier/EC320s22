# Introduction to Econometrics  

This repository contains materials for EC 320: Introduction to Econometrics, taught in the Spring of 2022 by [Emmett Saulnier](https://www.emmettsaulnier.com).  

This course introduces the statistical techniques that help economists learn about the world using data. We will focus much of our attention on regression analysis, the workhorse of applied econometrics. Using calculus and introductory statistics, we will cultivate a working understanding of the theory underpinning regression analysis—how it works, why it works, and when it can lead us astray. We will apply the insights of theory to work with and learn from actual data using R, a statistical programming language. To the extent that you invest the requisite time and effort, you can leave this course with marketable skills in data analysis and—most importantly—a more sophisticated understanding of the notion that correlation does not necessarily imply causation.
